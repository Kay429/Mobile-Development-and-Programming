Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
* The app I developed is an event tracker meant to help users manage their schedules. To meet user needs, my app was required to include two databases: one of users and another of events. Each user should have been able to create an account or log in if they had one, and then view and manage their events. This includes adding, editing, and deleting events in the database. Each user required their own list of events that only they could access. My app needed to notify users of upcoming events, which would also require asking for permission.

What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?

To meet the user's needs, my app needed screens dedicated to logging in, viewing the events list, editing/creating events, and setting notification permission. The UI needed to be clear to users on how to interact with the app, and instructions must be provided where the UI does not speak for itself. To create a clear and user-friendly UI, I tried to consider how easy it would be to navigate for someone who had never used it before. I asked questions such as "Will the user know what this button does without instruction?" and "How can I help the user to know what to do?". I also drew a lot of inspiration from other mobile app designs; when the UIs across apps remain fairly consistent, it becomes easy for new users to pick up on how to interact with an app.

How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?



How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?


Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?


In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
